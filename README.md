8) Create an empty schema named  "nodesimpledb" in mysql
9) Go to config\config.json and update the database details for development. Index.js file in the models folder is configured to selected the development 
   environment, thats the reason we are setting the details for development.
10) run command sequelize db:migrate
11) To revert, incase required.
    a) run command sequelize db:migrate:undo to revert the last command.
    b) run command sequelize db:migrate:undo:all
12) Create dbWriter.js to add methods for different actions required.
13) Created index.js in the root to test the methods. 
14) run node index.js to execute the methods.

Note:
a) Global node packages are installed at C:\Users\madhusudan.gohil\AppData\Roaming\npm
b) If you have existing database you can use sequelize-auto node package to generate models from database.
   you will need to install mysql package in global cache.
   npm install -g mysql
   sequelize-auto -o "./models" -d sequelize_auto_test -h localhost -u my_username -p 5432 -x my_password -e postgres
